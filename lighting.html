<div class="heading">Living Room </div>
<DIV class="set">
<ul>
<li>The lighting in a living room should allow people  to see each other easily</li>
<li>The lighting should be flattering and not revealing.</li>
<li>The most useful general purpose fitting for the living room is one with a large cylindrical shade and open top and bottom. This will give an up and down distribution which will give both direct light on ones book or sewing and diffused indirect light reflected off ceiling and upper walls.</li>
<li>The most satisfying form of lighting in a living room will be one that is flexible, giving a good level of illumination without glare at the main sitting positions, with an interesting and varied distribution of brightness through the main surfaces in the room, but avoiding exaggerated contrasts or contrived effects which can soon become tiresome.</li>
